## Mushroom: NoSQL Database
[中文版 README](./README.md)

### Mushroom: Multi-Thread NoSQL Database based on B<sup>link</sup> Tree Index

#### This is an upgrade of [Up Database](http://www.github.com/UncP/Up_Database) and [pear Database](http://www.github.com/UncP/pear)

### B<sup>link</sup> Tree Benchfuck
`key length: 16 bytes`  
`key tuples: 10 million`    
`CPU: 2.1 GHz  4 threads`

|  Version  |  Thread  |  Sorting Time(s) |           Improvements            |
|--------|:-------:|:-----------:|:--------------------------:|
| 0.1.0  |  Single |    16.00    ||
| 0.2.0  |  Multi  |    12.32    |   two-phase lock based concurrent index   |
| 0.2.1  |  Multi  |    11.28    |         latch manager optimization         |
| 0.3.0  |  Multi  |    10.94    |  prefix compaction, reducing B<sup>link</sup> tree memory about 9.1 % |
| 0.4.0  |  Multi  |    11.44    |  second-time mapping mulit-thread queue, reducing total program memory up to 50 %|
| 0.4.1  |  Multi  |    \    | merge latch manager and page manager，reduce 1 lock per operation |
| 0.4.2  |  Multi  |    \    | change the way B link tree root split |
| 0.4.3  |  Multi  |    \   |  new test strategy, threads conduct operations without going through the queue |
| 0.4.4  |  Multi  |    \   |  latch manager refactoring |
| 0.5.0  |  Multi  |    11.70 / 9.00   | fix **BUG** that exists from 0.4.1 to 0.4.4 |
